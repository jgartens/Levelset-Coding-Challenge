# Levelset-Coding-Challenge
Levelset's Coding Challenge as part of an application for a Software Development Engineer position with the company. Goals are to develop a web application which takes a CSV as input and outputs various reports. More details in readMe and attached PDF.


To Run The Application:

Make sure you have the latest version of java (JDK) installed
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html

Clone or download the repository into a folder of your choosing.  From the base in your command line (on a mac), run the following command:

java -jar /PATHTOYOURFOLDER/Levelset-Coding-Challenge-main/target/challenge-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Note: Command may be slightly different for windows users

If it's not working, make sure that your path and folder names are correct ^^ up to the target folder, which shouldn't have been changed.

Go to the web address specified in your terminal when the program finishes outputting (probably localhost:8080)

Follow prompts to use application
